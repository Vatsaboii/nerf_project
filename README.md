# nerf_project
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is an advanced machine learning model used to generate 3D representations from 2D images. Applying NeRF to the LRO (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) LAC (Lunar Anomalous Craters) dataset can potentially help in creating detailed 3D models of lunar craters. 


cnn_practice.ipynb - This file is the practice file of the implementation of the CNN and ANN on CIFAR-10 dataset, which is the foundation step of image classification and which would help me with the making of the NeRF model.

nerf.py - The is the module i tried to look and understand the way how the NeRF model is made and the functionalities reqired while conveerting the 2D images to 3D Models.

run_nerf.py - The is the module i tried to look and understand the way how the NeRF model is made and the functionalities reqired while conveerting the 2D images to 3D Models.

own_nerfmodel.py - This is the implementation of the of the NeRF model by trying to replicate from the pre existing models and trying to clone as near as i can by adding my own funcitonalities like "logging" feature, which would help me in the further debugging.
